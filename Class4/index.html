         <p id="primeiro">A sketch from around 1500 AD is attributed to Gian Giacomo Caprotti, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, but it was described by Hans-Erhard Lessing in 1998 as a purposeful fraud, a description now generally accepted.[1][2][3] However, the authenticity of the bicycle sketch is still vigorously maintained by followers of Augusto Marinoni, a lexicographer and philologist, who was entrusted by the Commissione Vinciana of Rome with the transcription of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus.[4][5 </p>
         <p id="segundo">Later, and equally unverified, is the contention that a certain "Comte de Sivrac" developed a célérifère in 1792, demonstrating it at the Palais-Royal in France. The célérifère supposedly had two wheels set on a rigid wooden frame and no steering, directional control being limited to that attainable by leaning.[6] A rider was said to have sat astride the machine and pushed it along using alternate feet. It is now thought that the two-wheeled célérifère never existed (though there were four-wheelers) and it was instead a misinterpretation by the well-known French journalist Louis Baudry de Saunier in 1891.[7][ </p>
         <p id="terceiro">In Japan, a pedal-powered tricycle called '陸舟奔車 (Rikushu-honsha)' was described in '新製陸舟奔車之記 (Records of a Newly Made Rikushu-honsha)' (owned by the Hikone Public Library, Hikone, Japan), written in 1732 by 平石久平次時光 (Hiraishi Kuheiji Tokimitsu) (1696-1771), a retainer of the Hikone domain.[9][10] However, it was not further developed, and the practical use of bicycles in Japan did not occur until modern bicycles were imported from Europe. </p>
